## Issues and Problems

The data has provided most of the important information that are needed in this project but it has some shortcomings. On the one hand, there are missing values in match data, player attribute data and team attribute data. We handled the missing values with different methods in Chapter4-missing values. On the other hand, the player attributes data has some players playing in minor leagues that cannot be found in player dataset. As a result, in this project we will be only analyzing the 11 most important leagues listed [here](https://www.football-data.co.uk/data.php).
