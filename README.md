STATS GR5702 EDAV Final Project: European Soccer Team Exploration

This project is mainly about seeking the relationship between the football player and football team data and match result. Here are the following questions generated from this main idea.

***Questions:***

1. Do teams in the same league share similar playing patterns?
2. How to predict the outcome of each game?
3. Is it possible to decide a way of gambling soccer games, given betting odds of each game?



***Data source Links:***

1. Player Data, Team Data:   ```https://sofifa.com```
2. Betting odds and match outcome ```https://www.football-data.co.uk/data.php```

To answer Q1, we will first select several significant team attributes and cluster data to identify if there are clusters. If we can find patterns on the graph, we can then determine if such cluster represent a league.

To answer Q2, we can plot scatterplots between each attribute with the outcome and select variables with a strong correlation with the outcome and then build a model to help predict the outcome.

To answer Q3, we compare the possibility of each outcome that the model predicted according to Q2 and the betting odds of each game to see if there is a profit-making strategy.
