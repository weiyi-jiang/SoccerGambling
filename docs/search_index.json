In Europe, this game is playing an especially essential role in every community as a cultural signature. A lot of cities enjoy their great football reputation and therefore attract tourism and boost economy to a large extent, including Milan, Barcelona, Manchester, Munchen and so on. There are over 1000 clubs playing in over 37 leagues all across Europe, among which there are the so-called “big-5”, the topmost league in England, Spain, Italy, Germany and France, attracting most spotlights around the world. The teams in these leagues are sharing the most part from the large independent economy. The 4 most valuable franchises in the world are currently each valued in excess of $3 billion. The rising ticket prices, growing commercial advertisements and profits by simply selling players are making managing a professional football club a remarkably lucrative venture. Modern football is played by two teams, 11 players each. Players are separated into strikers(ST), midfielders(MF), defenders(DF) and goalkeepers(GK). Only one GK at a time is allowed on the ground, who can touch the ball with hands in the penalty area. The formations of the team and the strategies of playing can be varied and sophisticated. The job of the head coach is to give instructions on the team, investigating the rivals and trying to make the best out of the current squads. The International Association of Football (FIFA), formed in 1904, centralizes the sport’s governance and overall management,including modifying soccer rules, organizing the FIFA World Cup and coordinating events. It has grown to be one of the most effective steward of the sport globally. The popular game FIFA series, authorized by FIFA, gives a simulation environment of the real football world. In this project, we are going to use the data of the players, teams and matches to analyze the skills of each player, explore playing style patterns of each team even of each league and give a prediction of the match outcome. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Data description 2.2 Issues and Problems", " Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Data description The data used for this project are downloaded and crawled from different related open data websites. After organizing we have the following datasets: player European players spanning 11 counties and 11 leagues. Attributes: player_id, player_name, birthday, height, weight Key: player_id Source team Reference dataset for the relevant teams. Attributes: team_id, team_long_name, team_short_name Key: team_id Source match Match outcomes dataset. Attributes: 62 columns including match scores and lineup of each team. Key: match_id Source player_attributes skill attributes for players. Attributes: 40 columns including 35 categories of football playing skills. Key: player_id Source team_attributes playing style for teams. Attributes: 23 columns including 20 categories of team playing styles. Key: team_id Source 2.2 Issues and Problems The data has provided most of the important information that are needed in this project but it has some shortcomings. On the one hand, there are missing values in match data, player attribute data and team attribute data. We handled the missing values with different methods in Chapter4-missing values. On the other hand, the player attributes data has some players playing in minor leagues that cannot be found in player dataset. As a result, in this project we will be only analyzing the 11 most important leagues listed here. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Player Attributes 3.2 Player Attributes 3.3 Team attributes", " Chapter 3 Data transformation The data from https://www.football-data.co.uk/data.php can be directly downloaded in csv format. We crawled the data from https://sofifa.com into json format with web crawler based on requests package and parsel package in python. We further transform the json into csv format as the raw data. The crawler is attached in the github repo. 3.1 Player Attributes There are 183978 players in this dataframe and only about 3000 rows contain NA values. Therefore, directly dropping NA variables is feasible. After that, we sample 5000 of them for a convenient plot. 3.2 Player Attributes There are 183978 players in this dataframe and only about 3000 rows contain NA values. Therefore, directly dropping NA variables is feasible. After that, we sample 5000 of them for a convenient plot. 3.2.1 Filtering goalkeepers We firstly check the normality of each column We firstly notice that for features starting with the characters “gk”, there is a significant deviance to normality. It is obviously because the goalkeepers are significantly better than other football players in these attributes. Since there is no information about whether one player is in charge of saving the goal. We decided to implement K-means clustering to classify them. We will not elaborate the specific ways to solve the problem since the project focuses on EDA. Before we implement this, we take a look at the histograms of “gk” features: It is easy to notice that for these features, there are two clusters and probably the higher score is for goalkeepers and the lower score is for other players. We notice that except gk_kicking, all clusters clearly separated the supposed goalkeepers and other players. We surmise that there are some players who are not goalkeepers playing well in kicking. The research conducted on the types of these players will be explored later. We can verify the justification of this clustering by simply looking at the count of goalkeepers and non-goalkeepers. In one sample, we found the total number of non-goalkeepers are 4596 and goalkeepers are 404. The ratio is 11.38. Notice that there are one goalkeeper with 10 other football players in the match so the theoretical ratio should be 10, which is close to 11.38. 3.2.2 Filtering guards We then take a look at the histograms for non-goalkeepers. From the histograms, we notice that four attributes contain bimodality. Those are ‘gk_kicking’, ‘standing_tackle’, ‘sliding_tackle’ and ‘marking’. We then make a scatter matrices for these four data. We realize that the last three features containing a high positive correlation. With bimodality and strong correlation, another clustering could be built. We feel that the clusters with higher score could be from the guards (or defenders). The clustering shows it separates guard and other players. We can verify the justification of this clustering by simply looking at the count of guards and non-guards. In one sample, we found the total number of non-guards are 2687 and guards are 1909. The ratio is 1.41. Notice that usually the formation of the team are “4-6” like (e.g. 4-4-2, 4-2-3-1, 4-3-3) so the theoretical ratio should be 1.5, while 1.41 is close to this ratio. ## # A tibble: 2 x 2 ## guard counts ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 0 180 ## 2 1 233 3.2.3 gk_kicking issue So what happend to “gk_kicking” high score non-goalkeepers? In this part, we would like to take a simple exploration. Firstly, we categorize the players based on whether the “gk_kicking” score is higher than 18. You can see why we choose 18 based on the following plot. Then we plot the difference between two class on other features. Boxplot is used to avoid overplotting issue and increase the computing efficiency. The result is as followed: It seems that there is no significant difference for other features. We also heard from other friends that this feature is trivial for non-goalkeepers. So we decide to discard this feature without further exploration. 3.2.4 further exploration of goalkeeper We implemented PCA on goalkeepers’ gk features and the biplot is shown as follow: We notice that there is high similarity between these tuples: (“gk_diving”, “gk_reflexes”) and (“gk_positioning”, “gk_handling”). That means we could create a new score from these two features in the tuple via dimension reduction. There seems no clustering but when we make a biplot for all features, a surprising thing happens: We see that there are two clusters of data and three clusters of features are generated. Therefore, we could apply KMeans on goalkeepers to generate two clusters. 3.2.5 further exploration of guards 3.2.6 further exploration of non-guards 3.3 Team attributes From missing data part we notice that the feature “buildUpPlayDribbling” contains NA values when “buildUpPlayDribblingClass” is little. Firstly we need to separately view the boxplot of “buildUpPlayDribbling” by “buildUpPlayDribblingClass” So different classes have different scores. Because we need to fill NA value in the Little class, we only draw the histogram of little class and we see that The result of shapiro test shows the p value is 0.0001525 so we would like to fill the NA value by the maximum likelihood estimation of the normal distribution (i.e. mean). 3.3.1 team biplot "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Team attributes 4.2 Player attributes 4.3 Match data", " Chapter 4 Missing values In the dataset, only team attributes, player attributes and match contain NA values. 4.1 Team attributes We see that only “buildUpPlayDribbling” has NA values. It is easy to think that the NA pattern of this attribute has something to do with “buildUpPlayDribblingClass”. So we take a look at it. As you can see, NA values are all in “little” class and nearly all sample with this class has an NA value in the score. 4.2 Player attributes As we can see, nearly all samples exist with no NA value. So in the data transformation we just throw them away. 4.3 Match data Since there are so many attributes in match data, we split it in two parts. One is about players and the other is about the bet odds. Other attributes, including the column country_id, league_id, season, stage, date, match_id, home_team_id, away_team_id, home_team_goal and away_team_goal has no missing data in it. We firstly take a look at the players_id in the data. Since there is no intrinsic difference for players with different index, what we do here is to count the number of missing values of players in the data. player_match = match[,0:32] player_match$na_count &lt;- apply(player_match, 1, function(x) sum(is.na(x))) ggplot(player_match, aes(x=na_count)) + geom_histogram(bins=22, color = &quot;blue&quot;, fill = &quot;lightblue&quot;) + labs(title = &quot;Count of Matches with 22 Play ID Recorded&quot;, x = &quot;number of NA&quot;, y = &quot;count&quot;) So as wee can see most data sample contains all 22 players’ id. Then in the data preprocessing session we just need to drop rows with NA values in players’ id. bet_match = match %&gt;% select(c(0:9, 33:62)) missing_patterns_plot(bet_match, T) We can see that there are numerous types of missing patterns about bets. Since we assume bets are irrelevant of the match result, this complex bet missing patterns are trivial to us.
